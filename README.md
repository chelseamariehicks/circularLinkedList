# circularLinkedList
Overview:
This program is a circular doubly linked list implementation of a deque with a front sentinel. It allows for the following behavior: adding a new link to the front/back, 	
getting the value of the front/back links, 
removing the front/back link, 
checking if the deque is empty,
printing the values of all the links, and 
reversing the order of the links 	

Note that this implementation uses double links (links with next and prev pointers) and that given that it is a circular linked deque the last link points to the sentinel and the first link points to the Sentinel--instead of null.
